# Frogger Crossing
===============

## Mission of the game

Imagine you are the little boy at the bottom of the field, your mission is to get across the road to reach the water without hitting the moving bugs. If you reach the water successfully you will get one score and if you are hit by a bug you will instead lose one score. Either getting a score or losing a score, you will automatically get back to the starting position and restart the game.

## How to play

Using your directional keys to move the little boy up, down, right and left.
